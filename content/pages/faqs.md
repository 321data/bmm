### Why are you doing this?

As written in my letter, it's because God is calling me to do it.

### Aren't you concerned with your health?

It's three days; I should be fine.

### What will your fast look like?

I won't eat any solid food. My wife may force-feed me some broth or milk. You'll see me kneeling outside the street entrance to the Diocesan Office (S Church and W Palmer) on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday between the hours of approximately 7am-9am while employees report to work.

### But it looks like only St. Mark's has stopped using the rails! Does this mean you will call it off?

No. I don't believe for a second Fr. Putnam spontaneously decided to end using communion rails after happening to re-read the _General Instruction for the Roman Missal_ (GIRM). There's ample evidence Bishop Martin has wanted to eliminate the usage of communion rails for some time. Additionally, the Cathedral has stopped using communion rails recently too.
