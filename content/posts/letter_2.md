_Author Note: This letter was sent in the form of an email on November 13, 2025 with a physical print-out mailed to the Bishop's office. The officers of the Presbyteral Council were emailed a copy as well. On November 26, 2025, a follow-up email was sent to the Bishop containing a copy of the below contents. A copy of that email was sent to every member of the Presbyteral Council (where I could find an email)._

> “Who is going to save our Church? Not our bishops, not our priests and religious. It is up to you, the people. You have the minds, the eyes, and the ears to save the Church. Your mission is to see that your priests act like priests, your bishops act like bishops, and your religious act like religious.”

_Venerable Fulton Sheen, June 1972_

Dear Bishop Martin,

I am a 34 year old sinner, husband, father of five children (one due this upcoming January), and Catholic of this Diocese for over 10 years.

Last year, I attended an Installation Mass where you gave a homily asking the congregation to trust their new pastor’s spiritual leadership and to not treat you and your office like “UPS customer service.” I find it ironic and sad you do not extend the same trust with your own priests, and God is commanding me to not just write a letter that will be treated as customer service.

The voice of God is clear: I will hold a public three day fast in front of the Diocesan office starting the first Monday of Advent unless you guarantee pastors and faithful the right to use Communion rails. While I personally hate the idea of being seen as an activist, God is calling me to do this and I cannot say no. The spiritual freedom for my family and the rest of the faithful, and the call to resist this abuse of power is too great to ignore.

In Christ,  
Michael Russell
