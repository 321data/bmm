      <p><em>Author Note: This letter was sent in the form of an email on November 13, 2025 with a physical print-out mailed to the Bishop&rsquo;s office. The officers of the Presbyteral Council were emailed a copy as well. On November 26, 2025, a follow-up email was sent to the Bishop containing a copy of the below contents. A copy of that email was sent to every member of the Presbyteral Council (where I could find an email).</em></p>
<p>Dear Bishop Martin,</p>
<p>There are substantiated reports that you intend to direct the priests of this Diocese to no longer allow the faithful to use Communion rails for the reception of Holy Communion. You must not follow through with this directive and instead allow the faithful to use Communion rails.</p>
<p>You are not suppressing an objectively wrong or sacrilegious act, such as bringing your pet to Communion or carelessly disposing a Consecrated Host that fell to the ground. Instead, you are suppressing an act of reverence before the King of Kings, something that, if anything, ought to be considered praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Any cursory reading of trends in the Catholic Church show that younger generations yearn for more traditional practice and devotion. Father James Martin, SJ knows this when he said to the 2025 LCWR Assembly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As we all know, there has been a shift in many young people’s desires for the church, and it is more toward the traditional.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this past September, National Catholic Reporter published an opinion piece from “That Black Catholic Chick”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Gen Z Catholics are not running toward novelty; they&rsquo;re running toward reverence. They are not demanding entertainment or watered-down theology. They are searching for transcendence, for something that pierces through the noise of modern life and brings them face-to-face with the sacred.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the priestly ordinations of 2024, you mentioned how priests should not think of priesthood as “their priesthood” or “their Church.” In a similar vein, Pope Leo XIV said in his October 26, 2025 homily:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The supreme rule in the Church is love. No one is called to dominate; all are called to serve. No one should impose his or her own ideas; we must all listen to one another. No one is excluded; we are all called to participate. No one possesses the whole truth; we must all humbly seek it and seek it together.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the same not apply to you? How is banning Communion rails in parishes you visit once, maybe twice a year not the zenith of imposing your personal preference upon entire parish communities? This directive is the pinnacle of rigid, callous authoritarianism diametrically opposed to any contemporary definition of synodality. If that sounds too harsh, wouldn’t you feel that way if a brother Bishop were to instead <em>mandate</em> the usage of Communion rails for all the parishes in a Diocese? Wouldn’t you consider that the height of clericalism? Wouldn’t you consider that an absolute rejection of subsidiarity and trust in the pastors of a Diocese? Wouldn’t the faithful who internally reject this abuse of power consider their Bishop as implicitly commanding them to “pay, pray, and obey”?</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“&hellip;Jesus summoned them and said, &lsquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones make their authority over them felt. But it shall not be so among you.&rsquo;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The faithful who wish to use Communion rails but are told they cannot will bitterly feel your authority lorded over them for no good reason. This is why your planned directive is an abuse of power and it will inflict grave spiritual harm. Pope Francis implored priests to be “shepherds with the smell of the sheep.” Please be this kind of shepherd to us. Do not issue this directive. Allow the faithful to Commune with our Lord using Communion rails when then Holy Spirit has guided the community and the consciences of the faithful to do so.</p>
